      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>Agio e olio is a classic Italian pasta dish from Naples, Italy.</p>
      <p>The name means "spaghetti with garlic and oil", highlighting its main ingredients!</p>
      <h4>Ingredients</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Spaghetti</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Red Pepper Flakes</li>
        <li>Parsley</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Parmesan Cheese</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Steps</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Cook the pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water according to the package instructions until al dente. Reserve about 1/2 cup of pasta cooking water before draining.</li>
        <li>While the pasta is cooking, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the sliced garlic and red pepper flakes. Cook, stirring frequently, until the garlic is fragrant and just starting to turn golden, about 1-2 minutes. Be careful not to let the garlic burn.</li>
        <li>Once the pasta is cooked, drain it and add it to the skillet with the garlic and oil. Toss well to coat the pasta evenly with the garlic-infused oil. If the pasta seems dry, add a splash of the reserved pasta cooking water to loosen it up.</li>
        <li>Season the pasta with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Toss again to combine.</li>
        <li>Serve the aglio e olio pasta immediately, garnished with chopped fresh parsley and grated Parmesan cheese if desired.</li>
      </ol>
