    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Bak kut teh is a popular dish in Southeast Asia, particularly among the Chinese community. It consists of pork ribs simmered in a flavorful broth infused with herbs and spices such as garlic, star anise, and peppercorns.</p>
    <p>There are two main variations: herbal and peppery. It's traditionally served with steamed rice or youtiao (Chinese fried dough). The dish is loved for its rich, savory broth and tender pork ribs.</p>
